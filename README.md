# Realms

Star Realms is a spaceship combat deckbuilding game. To learn to play, read the rules over at [White Wizard Games](http://www.starrealms.com/learn-to-play/)

I've created this to learn about and practice implementing strategic digital card games. If you're reading this and are also interested, shoot me an email.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'realms'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install realms

## Usage

This article is a stub [#7](https://github.com/tonywok/realms/issues/7)

### Game Client & Server

At the moment, there is only a super minimal [game server and client](https://github.com/tonywok/realms-world)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
